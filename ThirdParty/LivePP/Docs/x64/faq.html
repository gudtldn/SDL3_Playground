            <div class="answer">
              <p>This happens when both the compiler-generated .PDB file <span class="notranslate">(C/C++ -> Output Files -> Program Database File Name)</span> as well as the linker-generated .PDB file <span class="notranslate">(Linker -> Debugging -> Generate Program Database File)</span> are set to the same output file. In this case, the debugger will lock the .PDB file during debugging, while the compiler tries to write to the same file upon compilation.</p>
              <p>
              Please note that the .PDB file generated by the compiler is an <strong>intermediate</strong> file and not a build artefact. As such, it is best to leave the corresponding compiler option untouched. Furthermore, there have been reports of large projects suffering up to 4x longer link times (for incremental and full builds without using Live++) in cases where both compiler and linker wrote to the same .PDB file, so it is recommended to use separate files for compiler and linker PDBs.

            <div class="answer">
              <p>This is most likely caused by translation units that were not built with the correct <a href="documentation.html#compiler_settings">compiler settings</a>.</p>

            <summary>Live++ reports <strong>"Failed to determine vcvars*.bat environment for toolchain 'Foo'"</strong>.<br/>What do I need to change?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                When using the Visual Studio compiler or linker, a vcvars*.bat file needs to be invoked in order to set up the toolchain environment for subsequent compiling. Live++ automatically detects the toolchain that was used to build Live++-enabled applications and locates the corresponding vcvars*.bat file, as long as the relative paths of the default installation directory are kept intact.
              </p>
              <p>
                When using a custom toolchain or build system, the compiler (cl.exe) and linker (link.exe) are often kept in a non-default relative path structure, which makes finding the correct vcvars*.bat file harder. In this case, Live++ expects any of the following files in the same directory as the compiler or linker invoked:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    vcvars64.bat
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    vcvarsamd64_x86.bat
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    vcvarsx86_amd64.bat
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    vcvars32.bat
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Note that you can supply your own files for setting up the compiler environment and need not copy Visual Studio's files, as long as the file in question is correctly named.

            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                Does your setup use distributed/remote builds? If so, please make sure to set the <a href="documentation.html#distributed_builds">required preferences</a>.

            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                Make sure to <a href="documentation.html#linker_settings">generate full PDBs (e.g. using <span class="notranslate">/DEBUG:FULL</span>)</a> and not partial PDBs (e.g. using <span class="notranslate">/DEBUG:FASTLINK</span>).

            <summary>Live++ does nothing when pressing the shortcut.<br/>What am I missing?</summary>
            <div class="answer">
              <p>
                First, make sure that the <a href="documentation.html#usage_agents">Live++ agent has been created</a> and Live++ is enabled for the module (.EXE or .DLL) in question by calling one of the <a href="documentation.html#enabling_livepp">appropriate API functions</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                Second, remember to save your changes before pressing the shortcut. If Live++ still does nothing, it was unable to detect which translation units are part of your module. In this case, please check if your <a href="documentation.html#compiler_settings">compiler and linker settings</a> are correct.
              </p>
              <p>
                Third, ensure that Live++ can <a href="documentation.html#required_files">find all .PDB, .OBJ, .CPP and .H files</a> it needs in order to work.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the issue still persists and you cannot figure out why Live++ is not working with your setup, please <a href="mailto:support@molecular-matters.com">let us know</a>.
